# About the Language
  Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language    
  Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.    
  Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.    
  It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming.    
  Python is often described as a **batteries included** language due to its comprehensive standard library.    
  Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.
  
The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:

>Beautiful is better than ugly.
>
>Explicit is better than implicit.
>
>Simple is better than complex.
>
>Complex is better than complicated.
>
>Readability counts.
